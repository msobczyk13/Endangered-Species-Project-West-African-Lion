	    	<h2>Basic Information</h2>
	    	<p>African lions live in Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, 
	    	The Central African Republic, South Sudan, and other parts of 
	    	Sub-Saharan Africa. They wander a territory of 100 square miles.
	    	They eat large animals that they find in the grasslands, including 
	    	antelopes, zebras, and wildebeest. Lions are very social cats and 
	    	live in groups called prides. Lions begin to mate around the age 
	    	of 3 or 4. For the first 6 weeks of their lives, the cubs are hidden
	    	and are born around only three pounds. Lions fight with animals who
	    	are much larger than themselves. In order to do this, they use their 
	    	powerful jaws to snap the prey's neck or to strangle it to death.</p>

	    	<h2>What is a West African Lion?</h2>
	    	<p>A West African Lion is a type of cat who are now highly endangered
	    	and will soon disappear from West Africa, unless conservation efforts 
	    	improve. West African lions are lighter in build than the ones in East 
	    	and South Africa. They appear to have longer legs, and the males have 
	    	thinner manes. The are carnivorous and their predators are human. Their
	    	habitat is graddy plains and open woodlands, their life span is 10 to 14
	    	years in the wild; up to 20 years in captivity. They weigh around 330 to
	    	500 plus pounds. They are hunters and scavengers and West African Lions 
	    	are the most social cats. Also, Lions are very affectionate. Their parenting
	    	styles are wildly different. Most times, two or more females in a pride 
	    	give birth around the same time and the cubs are raised together. At times,
	    	a lion may neglect or abandon her cubs especially if food is scarce.</p>

	    	<h2>Conservation</h2>
	    	<p>The population of lions decreased 43% in 21 years. The African Lion is 
	    	regionally extinct in 7 African countries. Retaliation is the primary 
	    	reason for lion killings. People are working with communities in order for
	    	them to value lions and help protect their families and livestock. from large
	    	carnivores. West African Lions are mainly endangered because of hunting, 
	    	habitat loss, and diseases that can be spread from domestic dogs in villages
	    	nearby.<p>
	    	<p><b>The West African Lion's current population is estimated at 30,000 to
	    	100,000.</b> By the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List 
	    	of Threatened Species. The fate of the West African Lion will be decided in 
	    	the next five years. If we want to save them, we need to do something now.
	    	There needs to be committed individuals. However, the country is lacking the
	    	individuals as well as the sufficient amount of funding needed. If both of 
	    	these are gotten, then there will be hope. The secret to long-term success 
	    	will be supplementing conservation dollars with an alternative revenue stream,
	    	such as the nature-based tourism that pumps billions of dollars into South and
	    	East Africa every year, Said by Henschel. The way to improve people education
	    	on this topic is to train local guards. However, we need to all stay cautiously
	    	optimistic because one day the banks might all be inspired and fund the needs 
	    	that we need.</p>
